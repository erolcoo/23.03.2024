Backend Integration: Firebase is utilized as the backend for storing and managing data.
Authentication: User authentication is handled using local storage, ensuring secure access for logged-in users.

Architecture

Frontend:

Angular Framework: 

The frontend of the project is built using Angular, a powerful JavaScript framework for building web applications.
Component-Based Structure: Angular follows a component-based architecture, where each UI element is encapsulated within its own component, promoting modularity and reusability.

Services:

Angular services are used for communicating with the backend, managing authentication, and other shared functionalities across components.

Backend:

Firebase: Firebase is utilized as the backend service, offering real-time database capabilities and seamless integration with Angular applications.
Database: Firebase database is used for storing car-related data, user information, and authentication details.

Deployment:

Development Server:
During development, the project can be run locally using the Angular CLI development server (ng serve), providing a convenient environment for testing and debugging.

Build Process: 

To deploy the project to a production environment, the Angular CLI's build process (ng build) is used. This generates optimized build artifacts that can be deployed to a hosting service.

Hosting:

The built artifacts can be hosted on various platforms such as Firebase Hosting, Netlify, or AWS S3, making the application accessible to users worldwide.
This architecture ensures a robust and scalable application, leveraging the capabilities of Angular for frontend development and Firebase for backend services.
